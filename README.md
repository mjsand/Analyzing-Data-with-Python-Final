# Analyzing-Data-with-Python-Final - The goal of this project was to take a data file with data on the amount of beer, win, and spirits consumed by 
# every country around the world and analyze it for use by a make believe winer/brewery. This involved creating a dataframe from the data, performing
# a linear regression analysis on the data to try and predict total alcohol consumed by volume using the data for beer, wine, and spirits. This also 
# involved performing a multiple linear regression, polynomial transformation on the data and pipe fitting, linear ridge regression, and polynomial
# ridge regression with a second degree polynomial. Distribution plots were made for each type of regression and the R^2 values were calculated to 
# show the accuracies of the different models.
